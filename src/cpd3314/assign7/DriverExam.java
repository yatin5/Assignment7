/* Exercise #5 - Driver's License Exam
 *
 * The local Driver's License Office has asked you to write a program that
 * grades the written portion of the driver's license exam. The exam has 20
 * multiple choice questions. Here are the correct answer:
 * 1. B     6. A        11. B       16. C
 * 2. D     7. B        12. C       17. C
 * 3. A     8. A        13. D       18. B
 * 4. A     9. C        14. A       19. D
 * 5. C     10. D       15. D       20. A
 * A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions to pass the exam. 
 * Write a class named DriverExam that holds the correct answers to the exam in 
 * an array field. The class should also have an array field that holds the 
 * student's answers. 
 * The class should have the following methods:
 * - setAnswer(int, char) that sets a student answer the given value. For 
 *     example, setAnswer(4, 'C') would store C as the answer to the 4th 
 *     question. Note that the first question is #1 (not 0).
 * - passed() that returns true if the student answered at least 15/20 correct
 * - totalCorrect() that returns the number of correctly answered questions
 * - totalIncorrect() that returns the number of incorrectly answered questions
 * - questionsMissed() that returns an integer array containing the question
 *     numbers of the questions that the student missed. Note that the first
 *     question is #1 (not 0).
